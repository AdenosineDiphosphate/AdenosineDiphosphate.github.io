                    <p>This microscope is capable of diffraction-limited backscattered Raman imaging with 0.3 µm spatial resolution.  It is an ideal system for spatially-resolved Raman spectroscopy studies. Additionally, utilizing a selection of spectrally narrow or broad optics it can be used to sequentially image Raman, Photoluminescence, or Fluorescence from a wide variety of samples. The system is coupled to a Linkam Scientific reaction cell to perform in situ reactions of a sample in a controlled gaseous environment.  The cell can accommodate a broad range of environments with quickly interchangeable carrier gas flow and target evaporates at a controlled temperature up to 600 °C. The scanning Raman microscope is coupled to the cell through a quartz window to give an unobstructed view of the sample for Raman imaging during an experiment</p>

                    <p>A SPECS variable temperature STM is used for sample morphology characterization. Sample temperatures in the SPM nominally can range from 100K to 1500K. It has the capability of in situ dosing of the gas molecules and in situ light irradiation on the sample when it is at the STM measurement position. Its fast scanning capability (150000 pixels/s), achieved by high resonance frequencies of the scanner head is an ideal tool for probing chemical dynamics on the nanoscale. The high-pressure mercury lamp (Oriel Corporation) will be used to irradiate the samples. Besides STM, the ultrahigh vacuum apparatus is equipped with quadrupole mass spectrometry, ion sputter gun, low energy electron diffraction, Auger Electron spectroscopy, and high temperature effusion cell along with standard sample cleaning facilities.</p>

                    <h3>Fiber TERS Setup</h3>
                    <p>A lab-built STM was constructed that is capable of accepting optical fibers as probe tips. The fiber-capable STM consists of five main components: A scan block, piezo scan tube, sample positioning stage, and fiber coupler, and RHK R9 STM control electronics. The scan block provides a stable platform that houses and shields the piezo ceramic scan tube.  The fiber is placed in a removable tip holder and is routed to a fiber coupler containing an objective lens and fiber positioning stage to couple the optical fiber to a Raman spectroscopy system. The nanoscale approach is done via a Thorlabs Nanomax motor-controlled stage with a copper sample mount affixed to the stage. The scanning tube has a maximum scan range of 16 µm and a maximum extension of 2 µm.  Utilizing the R9 control system, the capable scan resolution is on the order of 0.01 nm with a stable system noise of less than 10 RMS pA. With tip in scan range, a 532 nm CW laser is coupled into the fiber via the aforementioned objective and then Raman detected at the tip is coupled back into the fiber and then back out of the same objective.  The signal is directed by several mirrors back along the laser path through a high pass filter to remove the 532 nm laser line before coupling it to a Princeton Instruments Isoplane spectrometer for analysis</p>

                    <p>A lab built optical-STM apparatus in the PI’s lab at BRIC will be used for UHV TERS study when needed. The apparatus consists of a UHV preparation/analysis chamber, a dedicated UHV STM (RHK) chamber (a) and a home-build optical Raman setup (b). The chamber is equipped with a UV source and a gas delivery system. The base pressure is 10-11 Torr. The STM utilizes a “walker” scan head mounted over a sample holder. This arrangement minimizes the temperature- and pressure-induced drifts. The UHV TERS setup has been successfully tested by resolving 2 nm thick copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) Raman peaks on an Au(111) single crystal. 
                    The STM sample preparation and characterization will be carried out in the standard UHV system equipped with an e-beam evaporator, quadrupole mass spectrometry, ion sputtering gun, low energy electron diffraction, and Auger Electron spectroscopy. The UHV chamber is equipped with a dedicated thermal evaporator to prepare monolayers of molecules on well-defined thin film samples. A doser is available inside the UHV chamber for dosing molecules onto the substrates</p>

The chamber is equipped with a low temperature effusion cell (NTEZ 40-10-22), which will be used to evaporate and form molecular thin films on various substrates. The effusion cell technology (with temperature monitoring and feedback systems included) ensures highly controllable and reproducible evaporation of various materials. This equipment can heat source materials up to 800 °C. A quartz crystal sensor will be used to calibrate actual flux of molecular beams. The team has previously used this system to deposit CuPc molecules onto MoS2 and polycarbon nanotubes.</p>

                    <p>A commercial multimode AFM (Bruker) at Baylor will be updated to EC-SPM with electrochemical capability for liquid photocatalytic studies. Brucker is one of the leading companies in SPM. The multimode SPM is the most versatile SPM that has the capability of heating, cooling, gaseous environmental control, and applications in liquid. A Fiber TERS setup has been constructed using Brucker multimode SPM with our collaborator, Prof. Kunze-Liebhäuser at University of Innsbruck at Austria. A simple modified tip adaptor has been designed to integrate the fiber tip into the Brucker multimode SPM. We have tested our fiber TERS probe. EC-STM provides the local changes of surface morphology during electrochemical reactions. Integration of fiber-TERS in liquid would enable chemical imaging of materials in electrolytes in a SPM liquid cell.
