                    <h3>Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) Tip-Enhanced Raman Apparatus</h3>
                    <p>A home built optical-STM apparatus at BRIC is used for UHV TERS study. The apparatus consists of a UHV
                    preparation/analysis chamber, a dedicated UHV STM (RHK) chamber (a) and a home-build optical Raman setup (b). The
                    chamber is equipped with a UV source and a gas delivery system. The base pressure is 10-11 Torr. The STM utilizes a
                    “walker” scan head mounted over a sample holder. This arrangement minimizes the temperature- and pressure-induced
                    drifts. The UHV TERS setup has been successfully tested by resolving 2 nm thick copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) Raman peaks on an Au(111) single crystal.The STM sample preparation and characterization will be carried out in the standard UHV system equipped with an e-beam evaporator, quadrupole mass spectrometry, ion sputtering gun, low energy electron diffraction and Auger Electron spectroscopy. The UHV chamber is equipped with a dedicated thermal evaporator to prepare monolayers of molecules on
                    well-defined thin film samples. A doser is available inside the UHV chamber for dosing molecules onto the substrates</p>

                    <p>A UHV chamber is designed for deposition of CuPc, and other molecules onto substrates. The chamber is equipped with a low temperature effusion cell (NTEZ 40-10-22), which will be used to evaporate and form molecular thin films on various substrates. The effusion cell technology (with temperature monitoring and feedback systems included) ensures highly controllable and reproducible evaporation of various materials. This equipment can heat source materials up to 800 °C. A quartz crystal sensor will be used to calibrate actual flux of molecular beams. The team has previously used this system to deposit CuPc molecules onto MoS2 and polycarbon nanotubes.</p>

                    <p>With the recently awarded NSF MRI fund, we will install a high-performance Electron Beam Lithography System at Baylor University with the budget of ~ $1M. The Ebeam lithography system provides reliable and powerful methods to create patterns with sub-10 nm resolution in a large area. The tool provides ultrahigh resolution patterning (8 nm) in combination with the highest level of automation for complex applications. We will use the Ebeam lithography system to fabricate nano-antenna on fiber and to pattern nanostructures near the metallic tip for the TERS fiber applications. Patterning of 2D materials for TERS experiments will also be investigated.</p>
